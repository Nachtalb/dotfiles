# dotfiles

My Linux configuration.

These dotfiles work with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and
[fischer](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) in `~/.config/fish`.

The install script creates a pyenv virtualenv named `nvim` as it uses the same
as my [vimconfig](https://github.com/Nachtalb/vimconfig) uses. So that I don't
create unnecessary duplicates.

To create the symlinks use the `dotfiles_install_symlinks` command.

It uses the https://starship.rs/ prompt
