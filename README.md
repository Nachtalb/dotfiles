# dotfiles

My Linux configuration.

These dotfiles work with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and [fischer](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) in `~/.config/fish`. 

The install script creates a pyenv virtualenv named `nvim` as it uses the same as my [vimconfig](https://github.com/Nachtalb/vimconfig) uses. So that I don't create unnecessary duplicates.
